	<img src="https://republicmonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HIV-testing.png">
	<b>The Mindanao Advocates Against AIDS, Inc (MAAAI)</b> is an institution that gives treatment to those who have HIV/AIDS through their physical facilities that provide HIV Testing services, STI Laboratory, and HIV Treatment. The institution also educates people about HIV/AIDS by providing them lectures about Teenage pregnancy, STI, HIV/AIDS consultations, lectures & training online. In this way, the cases of HIV/AIDS will be lessened.<br><br> 
	The goal of the institution is to treat and help those people with HIV/AIDS to live a better and normal life, especially minors. The MAAAI provides programs and services such as HIV Testing services (HIV Counseling & Testing); STI (Sexually Transmitted Infections) management and treatment; Lectures on Teenage Pregnancy, STI/HIV-AIDS, SOGIE (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity & Expression), Community-based Screening (CBS); HIV Treatment; and, Young People Training on HIV/SOGIE/Stigma & Discrimination. We find these important because it shows the efforts that the MAAAI did to address the concern of HIV/AIDS.

	We believe that geometry concepts such as Inductive Reasoning can help us in our task as reflective problem-solver by enhancing our skills in problem-solving. Inductive Reasoning is all about drawing conclusions from observations and given data factors. In other words, conjectures or conclusions are made from patterned observations. <br>In our ET3/PT, we can use this to achieve the goal to raise awareness about MAAAI and HIV/AIDS to help in solving the needs of the institution and to contribute in achieving the institutionâ€™s advocacy which is to implement treatment and awareness about HIV/AIDS.<br><br> 
	It is important to <b>raise awareness</b> in this type of community as students like us tend to be ignorant towards things like these, thinking that since we already know about this then we should be able to prevent it. But, simply knowing about these diseases will not prevent them from affecting us in the future, as our generation tends to be risky and try new things without doing research or having knowledge about such things beforehand.<br><br>
	The data reflect on us as Ateneans through how reliable and valid the data that we gathered and presented reflecting on how honest and good willed we are in that the data could show how we truly want to help people who are affected and how much of this we are simply doing because we told to do the task showing how honest, caring and truthful we truly are.

	<img class = "webdes" src = "1.png"> 
	<h1 class = "webdesn">Marithe Kathrice Baclay - Leader</h1>
	<p class ="webdesc">Despite being shy and introverted, she has been chosen as leader due to her qualities such as good leadership, compassion, cleverness, and a hard-working attitude that pushes the other group members to do their best. When not doing her duties as a leader, however, she likes to spend her time playing games like Valorant, Genshin Impact, Project Sekai, Minecraft, and more. Aicy loves to listen to music, music helping her focus on studies, relax, and even come up with new ideas. Her music taste is very wide as she can enjoy listening to several genres namely K-Pop (New Jeans, etc.), Jazz (Laufey), indie (Arctic Monkeys & Beabadoobee), phonk (Kordhell), and many more. Lastly, for the past 9 years, Aicy has been taking care of her sister, who has autism, and with the help of her sister she has learned to be more patient with others and to look at the bigger picture.
