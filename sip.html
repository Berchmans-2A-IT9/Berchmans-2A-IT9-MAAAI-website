	<img class ="bgs" src = "https://healthiersteps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/healthierlifesyle.jpg">
	The Mindanao Advocates Against AIDS, Inc (MAAAI) exists in order to fight against one of the well-known issues in Mindanao; STI-HIV/AIDS. Its advocacy is to control the cases of AIDS hence this institution aims to educate Bisayas/Davaoeneos about AIDS; bring upon knowledge on how to prevent this, especially for minors, as this is a common issue present in the community. The MAAAI provides programs and services such as HIV Testing services (HIV Counseling & Testing); STI (Sexually Transmitted Infections) management and treatment; Lectures on Teenage Pregnancy, STI/HIV-AIDS, SOGIE (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity & Expression), Community-based Screening (CBS); HIV Treatment; and, Young People Training on HIV/SOGIE/Stigma & Discrimination. The institution has HIV Testing services, an STI Laboratory, and HIV Treatment as part of our physical facilities. The primary beneficiaries of this institution are mainly education and prevention of AIDS which can where in this way we can establish a healthier community. In our Science Investigatory Project, we are to study using compost (banana and carrot compost) as fertilizers to Radish seedlings and how this can affect the plant growth (height). Finding out what natural fertilizer is the best between banana and carrot peel fertilizer to develop efficient plant growth as nutrients from these fertilizers (nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium) help in achieving efficient plant growth of radishes. The importance of this study in relation to our project in helping out MAAAI is that educating about the simple matter of having a healthy lifestyle through effective and low budget planting and composting (fertilizer) as this can help people living with AIDS to avoid complications of the disease and can help with their immune system through the nutrients and vitamins they receive from what they eat daily. <br>


   <h2><b><a name ="pb">STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</a></b></h2>
Which between 5% of carrot peels, 10% of carrot peels, 5% of banana peels  and 10% of banana peels will have a better effect on height growth of radish sprouts? 
sprouts? <br>
    <a name="hyp"></a><h2><b>HYPOTHESIS</b><br></h2>
	If I use 10% of banana peels rather than 5%/10% of carrot peels or 5% of banana peels then the radish sprouts will be taller than the other plants.
	
	<h2><b>REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE</b><a name="rrl"></a></br></h2>
	<img class = "rrl" src = "https://www.loveyourlandscape.org/media/19998/1.jpg">
(1) Compost is created by combining food leftovers and yard debris, such as raked leaves and undergoing the process of decomposition. The process of composting includes chopping off food waste (in our case, we will be using banana peels and carrot peels; banana peels on setup A, and carrot peels on setup B) and with compost (soil), we will mix them in a container with holes on the bottom of the container for air flow, water the mix, then leave it for 2-3 weeks to decompose (Note: it is necessary to implement proper monitoring of the compost mix.) 
<br><br>The value of compost to plants is that it's a natural fertilizer and doesn’t require the use of chemical fertilizers. Compost enhances soil structure, offers a variety of nutrients for plants, and introduces helpful bacteria into the soil. Whether you compost in your garden, it minimizes your garbage and helps fight climate change in a modest manner.

<p> (2) The plant that our group will focus on is Raphanus sativus L or well known as radish (seedlings). Radishes like plenty of phosphorus as this helps in several aspects of plant growth, naming flowering, root development, and water content, and energy transfer through plant structure. Potassium is also vital in the success of growing a radish since this nurtures the growth of roots. Radish roots absorb phosphorus in the form of orthophosphate, but can also absorb certain forms of organic phosphorus. Phosphorus and potassium moves to the root surface through diffusion. The healthy levels of these nutrients are needed by the plant is 25 to 50 ppm (parts per million) of phosphorus and 40 to 80 ppm (parts per million) of Potassium. <br>

<p>(3) Carrot peel and Banana peel compost. It is stated that Bananas and Carrots contain nutrients that houseplants love. When these skins undergo decomposition, banana peels and carrot peels release potassium and small amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium. And as stated above, radishes are fond of soil that is rich in potassium as this can help their growth in many ways. As stated from the first item, the process of composting includes chopping off food waste (in our case, we will be using banana peels and carrot peels; banana peels on setup A, and carrot peels on setup B) and with compost (soil), we will mix them in a container with holes on the bottom of the container for air flow, water the mix, then leave it for 2-3 weeks to decompose (Note: it is necessary to implement proper monitoring of the compost mix.)  <br> 
<br> 
<br>

(4) The benefits the compost could provide to the plant is that it ensures that the plant has access to every essential nutrient it needs to be able to grow properly and healthily. Decreasing the chances that the plant might have stunted growth, brown spots on leaves, leaf necrosis, withered or stunted leaves, leaf tip burn, blossom end rot in fruit and finally leaf chlorosis. Ensuring that the plant is able to grow  at its healthiest providing us with the best results the plan is able to offer. This occurs through the process of mineralization. Mineralization is the conversion of a nutrient from the organic (i.e. bound to carbon and hydrogen) form to the inorganic form. The process occurs when organic materials, such as soil organic matter, manure, plant residue, or biosolids, are decomposed by soil microorganisms.<br>

<p>(5) One effective way to apply the compost to the radish and soil environment is by applying the dark finished compost and  sprinkle compost on top or mix it into your flower and vegetable beds, gently rake compost into tree beds, blend it with potting soil to revitalize indoor plants, or spread it on top of the soil on your lawn as a soil amendment.  To specify, When establishing new turf, incorporate up to 3 inches of compost into the existing soil base. If possible, till to a depth of 5–8 inches before seeding. Otherwise, seed directly over the compost. Spread 1–2 inches of compost on top of perennial and annual beds in the early spring or fall to prevent weeds from establishing and to make plants more drought-resistant. The compost should be administered to the plant one time only, at least 3 days after planting the seedling.<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p> (6.1) Plant nutrients such as vitamin C, Beta-carotene, and Niacin are delivered by both carrot and banana compost.
 Carrot fertilizer is rich in concentrated  amounts of vitamin C ,beta-carotene and niacin which helps the plant protect itself from the stresses that the environment will bring.<br><br>
 The functions of each nutrients mentioned are the following:<br><br>
<b>Vitamin c</b> controls the division, elongation, and differentiation of cells, as well as programmed cell death. As well as to handle and deal with the stresses that may come from the environment such as a drought, vitamin c  is produced by the plant to act as an antioxidant and coenzyme in metabolic reactions that help protect the plant.<br><br>
<b>beta-carotene</b> increases both the light-harvesting and photoprotective capacity of the photosystems allowing them to protect themselves from excessive amounts of light and superoxide radicals which could harm the plant.<br><br>
<img class = "rrl" src = "rrl6.png">
<b>niacin</b> are suggested to be stress signals in plant cells and what they do is that both Nicotinamide and nicotinic acid protect against plant cell leakage and DNA damage inside of the plant as well as both Nicotinamide and nicotinic  being able to increase acid aconitase and fumarase activities that helps the plant protect itself much more.<br><br>

 One of the mechanisms for nutrient metabolism is photosynthesis. This helps the plants to efficiently transfer other essential nutrients and water between plant cells, and regulates enzyme activity involving carbon and nitrogen metabolism in the plant.<br>
